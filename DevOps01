DevOps is a culture and set of practices that bridge software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops) to enhance collaboration, automation, and continuous delivery. By integrating tools like CI/CD pipelines, infrastructure as code (IaC), and monitoring, DevOps accelerates deployment, improves reliability, and fosters innovation. Itâ€™s not just about toolsâ€”itâ€™s about breaking silos, automating workflows, and delivering value faster. ðŸš€
